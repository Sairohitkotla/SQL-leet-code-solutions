Problem statement:
Write an SQL query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.
The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Problem solution:
with CTE as 
( 
  select Customer_id , product_id , count(product_id) as ct from orders
  group by 1,2 
)
select customer_id , CTE.product_id , product_name from CTE  
join products p on
p.product_id = CTE.product_id 
where (customer_id, ct)  in ( select customer_id , max(ct) from
 CTE  group by 1
)
