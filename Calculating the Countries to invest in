Problem Statement:
A telecommunications company wants to invest in new countries. 
The company intends to invest in the countries where the average call duration of the calls in this country is strictly greater than the global average call duration.
  Write an SQL query to find the countries where this company can invest.

Return the result table in any order.
Problem Solution:
With CTE as (
  select caller_id ,duration, co.name from calls c join person p on c.caller_id = p.id 
  join Country co on left(p.phone_number,3) = co.country_code
  union all 
  select callee_id ,duration, co.name from calls c join person p on c.callee_id = p.id 
  join Country co on left(p.phone_number,3) = co.country_code
)
#select C.name, avg(ca.duration)/(select 2*(sum(duration))/20 from calls) from 
select name as Country from CTE group by name having 
avg(duration)> (select avg(duration)from CTE )
