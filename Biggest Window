Problem: 
Write a solution that will, for each user_id, find out the largest window of days between each visit and the one right after it (or today if you are considering the last visit).
Return the result table ordered by user_id.

Solution: select user_id , max(datediff(next_visit,visit_date)) as biggest_window from
 (
select user_id, visit_date , ifnull(lead(visit_date,1) over ( partition by user_id order by visit_date),
'2021-1-1') as next_visit
from  uservisits) a  group by user_id ;
