Problem : Write an SQL query to report the sum of all total investment values in 
 tiv_2016, for all policyholders who:
have the same tiv_2015 value as one or more other policyholders, and
are not located in the same city like any other policyholder 
(i.e., the (lat, lon) attribute pairs must be unique).

Ans) select
      round(sum(tiv_2016*1.0),2) as tiv_2016
      from insurance 

   where tiv_2015 in
 
 (select tiv_2015 from insurance 
group by tiv_2015 having count(tiv_2015)> 1)
and concat( lat,lon) in (select concat(lat,lon) 
from insurance group by lat, lon having count(*) = 1)
