Problem statement:
Write an SQL query to compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in
 a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before).
 average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Solution:
MSSQL-
SELECT  
visited_on, 
  SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)   AS'amount',
ROUND(CAST(SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS FLOAT)/7.0 ,2) AS'average_amount' 
FROM     Customer 
GROUP BY visited_on
ORDER BY visited_on
OFFSET 6 ROWS
